  "prompt": "You are a master curator of knowledge. Your job is to identify what new insights should be added to an existing playbook based on a reflection from a previous attempt.\n\n**Context:**\n- The playbook you created will be used to help answering similar questions. \n- The reflection is generated using ground truth answers that will NOT be available when the playbook is being used. So you need to come up with content that can aid the playbook user to create predictions that likely align with ground truth. \n\n**CRITICAL: You MUST respond with valid JSON only. Do not use markdown formatting or code blocks.**\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Review the existing playbook and the reflection from the previous attempt\n- Identify ONLY the NEW insights, strategies, or mistakes that are MISSING from the current playbook\n- Avoid redundancy - if similar advice already exists, only add new content that is a perfect complement to the existing playbook\n- Do NOT regenerate the entire playbook - only provide the additions needed\n- Focus on quality over quantity - a focused, well-organized playbook is better than an exhaustive one\n- Format your response as a PURE JSON object with specific sections\n- For any operation if no new content to add, return an empty list for the operations field\n- Be concise and specific - each addition should be actionable\n\n\n**Training Context:**\n- Total token budget: 80000 tokens\n- Training progress: Sample 5 out of 15\n\n**Current Playbook Stats:**\n{\n  \"total_bullets\": 0,\n  \"high_performing\": 0,\n  \"problematic\": 0,\n  \"unused\": 0,\n  \"by_section\": {}\n}\n\n**Recent Reflection:**\n{\"reasoning\": \"모델의 추론 과정을 살펴보면, 지게차가 적재물을 높이 들어 시야가 가려졌고, 별도의 유도자가 없는 상태에서 보행자와 충돌했다는 점을 지적하고 있습니다. 이로 인해 발생한 안전 위험 요소로는 지게차의 시야 제한과 유도자 부재를 언급하며, 위반된 핵심 수칙으로는 작업장 내 시야 확보와 인력 배치 관련 규정을 설명하고 있습니다.\", \"error_identification\": \"모델의 예측 답변이 실제 정답과 일치하므로 오류 식별할 사항이 없습니다.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"모델의 예측 답변은 정확하며, 추가적인 개념적 오류나 계산상의 실수가 없습니다.\", \"correct_approach\": \"현재 모델의 접근 방식은 올바르며 수정할 필요가 없습니다.\", \"key_insight\": \"작업장 내에서 안전을 유지하기 위해서는 전방 시야 확보와 유도자 배치가 필수적이라는 원칙을 기억하면 됩니다.\", \"bullet_tags\": []}\n\n**Current Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n\n**Question Context:**\n\n\n**Your Task:**\nOutput ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- operations: a list of operations to be performed on the playbook\n  - type: the type of operation to be performed\n  - section: the section to add the bullet to\n  - content: the new content of the bullet\n\n**Available Operations:**\n1. ADD: Create new bullet points with fresh IDs\n    - section: the section to add the new bullet to\n    - content: the new content of the bullet. Note: no need to include the bullet_id in the content like '[ctx-00263] helpful=1 harmful=0 ::', the bullet_id will be added by the system.\n\n**RESPONSE FORMAT - Output ONLY this JSON structure (no markdown, no code blocks):**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations here]\",\n  \"operations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ADD\", \n      \"section\": \"formulas_and_calculations\",\n      \"content\": \"[New calculation method...]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n---\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The recent reflection indicates that there were no errors identified, root cause analysis was accurate, correct approach confirmed, and key insight about maintaining safety through visibility and proper staffing was highlighted. However, since the model's performance was satisfactory without any issues raised, it suggests that the current playbook does not require additional insights or corrections.\",\n  \"operations\": []\n}",
