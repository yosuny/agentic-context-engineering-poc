  "prompt": "You are an expert analyst and educator. Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 회전하는 기어박스 소음을 확인하기 위해 작업자 이 영희가 덮개를 열고 청진봉을 갖다 대었습니다. 회전체에 말려들어갈 위험이 있는 헐렁한 옷소매를 입고 있었습니다.\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given scenario, we identify two primary safety hazards and associated safety regulation violations. Firstly, the worker, Lee Young-hee, opened the cover of a rotating gearbox to inspect noise levels, thereby exposing themselves to potential entanglement risks from the moving parts. This action violates basic safety rules concerning lock-out/tag-out (LOTO) procedures, specifically failing to properly isolate energy sources before performing maintenance tasks. Secondly, wearing loose-sleeved clothing near rotating machinery presents another significant hazard, as it can easily get caught in the moving parts, leading to severe injury. The situation also highlights negligence toward personal protective equipment guidelines.\", \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"sai-00001\", \"sai-0004\", \"sai-0005\", \"sai-0008\", \"sai-00010\", \"sai-00011\", \"sai-00012\", \"sai-00015\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"The identified safety risk elements involve exposure to rotating machinery without proper LOTO procedures and wearing loose clothing near hazardous equipment.

  "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"The model's reasoning correctly identifies the main safety issues related to the scenario involving Lee Young-hee. It points out the failure to follow Lock-Out/Tag-Out (LOTO) procedures when dealing with rotating machinery and the danger posed by wearing loose clothing near such equipment. However, the final predicted answer diverges significantly from the provided ground truth, indicating a misunderstanding of the core issue described in the scenario.\", \"error_identification\": \"The model incorrectly emphasized LOTO procedures and loose clothing as the primary safety violations, whereas the actual violation pertains directly to the prohibition against opening covers around rotating machinery and maintaining neat attire. The model overextended its focus beyond the immediate context presented.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"This discrepancy arises due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the scenario\\u2019s emphasis on direct interaction with rotating components rather than broader procedural lapses like LOTO. The model failed to recognize that the critical rule being broken here relates more closely to immediate operational safety measures rather than preparatory ones.\", \"correct_approach\": \"To address this accurately, the response should center on pinpointing the explicit safety risks tied to handling rotating machines, particularly focusing on avoiding contact through open covers and ensuring proper dress codes. Highlighting these specifics would align better with the scenario details.\", \"key_insight\": \"Understanding situational context deeply matters; prioritize identifying immediate operational hazards within scenarios rather than broadly applicable but less relevant safety principles unless they're clearly implicated.\", \"bullet_tags\": [{\"id\": \"sai-00001\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}, {\"id\": \"sai-00010\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}, {\"id\": \"sai-00011\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}]}",
