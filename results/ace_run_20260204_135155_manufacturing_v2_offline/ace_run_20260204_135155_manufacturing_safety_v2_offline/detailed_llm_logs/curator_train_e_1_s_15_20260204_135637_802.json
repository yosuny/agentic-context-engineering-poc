  "prompt": "You are a master curator of knowledge. Your job is to identify what new insights should be added to an existing playbook based on a reflection from a previous attempt.\n\n**Context:**\n- The playbook you created will be used to help answering similar questions. \n- The reflection is generated using ground truth answers that will NOT be available when the playbook is being used. So you need to come up with content that can aid the playbook user to create predictions that likely align with ground truth. \n\n**CRITICAL: You MUST respond with valid JSON only. Do not use markdown formatting or code blocks.**\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Review the existing playbook and the reflection from the previous attempt\n- Identify ONLY the NEW insights, strategies, or mistakes that are MISSING from the current playbook\n- Avoid redundancy - if similar advice already exists, only add new content that is a perfect complement to the existing playbook\n- Do NOT regenerate the entire playbook - only provide the additions needed\n- Focus on quality over quantity - a focused, well-organized playbook is better than an exhaustive one\n- Format your response as a PURE JSON object with specific sections\n- For any operation if no new content to add, return an empty list for the operations field\n- Be concise and specific - each addition should be actionable\n\n\n**Training Context:**\n- Total token budget: 80000 tokens\n- Training progress: Sample 15 out of 15\n\n**Current Playbook Stats:**\n{\n  \"total_bullets\": 3,\n  \"high_performing\": 0,\n  \"problematic\": 1,\n  \"unused\": 2,\n  \"by_section\": {\n    \"STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\": {\n      \"count\": 1,\n      \"helpful\": 0,\n      \"harmful\": 5\n    },\n    \"COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\": {\n      \"count\": 1,\n      \"helpful\": 0,\n      \"harmful\": 0\n    },\n    \"OTHERS\": {\n      \"count\": 1,\n      \"helpful\": 0,\n      \"harmful\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n**Recent Reflection:**\n{\"reasoning\": \"사고 상황을 분석한 결과, 주요 안전 위험 요소로는 지게차의 허용 하중 초과, 급선회 시의 안전 속도 미준수, 그리고 운전자의 안전벨트 미착용 등이 확인됩니다. 이러한 요인들은 모두 작업 현장에서의 기본적인 안전 규칙을 위반한 것으로 볼 수 있으며, 특히 지게차의 허용 하중 초과는 장비의 안정성을 해치고 사고를 유발할 가능성을 높입니다.\", \"error_identification\": \"모델의 예측 답변이 실제 정답과 일치하므로 오류가 없습니다.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"이번 분석에서는 특별한 오류가 발견되지 않았습니다. 그러나 모델이 제공한 정보에는 추가적인 세부 사항들이 포함되어 있어 이를 간결하게 정리할 필요가 있습니다.\", \"correct_approach\": \"현재 접근 방식은 정확하며, 다만 최종 답변을 더 간결하게 표현하면 좋겠습니다.\", \"key_insight\": \"안전 규칙을 철저히 준수하고, 모든 작업 환경에서 허용 하중과 속도를 엄수하며, 개인 보호 장비를 항상 착용하는 것이 중요합니다.\", \"bullet_tags\": []}\n\n**Current Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n[sai-00001] helpful=0 harmful=5 :: Emphasize the significance of LOTO (Lock-Out, Tag-Out) procedures in industrial settings. Explain how LOTO prevents unexpected energy release during maintenance activities.\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Highlight common errors related to neglecting LOTO procedures, such as failing to secure all energy sources before maintenance work begins.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n[misc-00003] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Include indicators that suggest the necessity of LOTO implementation, e.g., scenarios involving equipment servicing or adjustments where unintended activation could pose risks.\n\n**Question Context:**\n\n\n**Your Task:**\nOutput ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- operations: a list of operations to be performed on the playbook\n  - type: the type of operation to be performed\n  - section: the section to add the bullet to\n  - content: the new content of the bullet\n\n**Available Operations:**\n1. ADD: Create new bullet points with fresh IDs\n    - section: the section to add the new bullet to\n    - content: the new content of the bullet. Note: no need to include the bullet_id in the content like '[ctx-00263] helpful=1 harmful=0 ::', the bullet_id will be added by the system.\n\n**RESPONSE FORMAT - Output ONLY this JSON structure (no markdown, no code blocks):**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations here]\",\n  \"operations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ADD\", \n      \"section\": \"formulas_and_calculations\",\n      \"content\": \"[New calculation method...]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n---\n",
