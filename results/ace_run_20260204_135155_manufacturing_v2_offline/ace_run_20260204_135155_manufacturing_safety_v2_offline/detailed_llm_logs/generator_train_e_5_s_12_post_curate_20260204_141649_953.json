  "prompt": "You are an analysis expert tasked with answering questions using your knowledge, a curated playbook of strategies and insights and a reflection that goes over the diagnosis of all previous mistakes made while answering the question.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Read the playbook carefully and apply relevant strategies, formulas, and insights\n- Pay attention to common mistakes listed in the playbook and avoid them\n- Show your reasoning step-by-step\n- Be concise but thorough in your analysis\n- If the playbook contains relevant code snippets or formulas, use them appropriately\n- Double-check your calculations and logic before providing the final answer\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- bullet_ids: each line in the playbook has a bullet_id. all bulletpoints in the playbook that's relevant, helpful for you to answer this question, you should include their bullet_id in this list\n- final_answer: your concise final answer\n\n\n**Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n[sai-00001] helpful=11 harmful=18 :: Emphasize the significance of LOTO (Lock-Out, Tag-Out) procedures in industrial settings. Explain how LOTO prevents unexpected energy release during maintenance activities.\n[sai-00004] helpful=11 harmful=25 :: 사고 분석 시 원인과 관련된 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반 사항을 명확히 기술하도록 강조합니다. 예를 들어, 지게차 사고의 경우 시야 제한이나 유도자 부재를 전방 시야 확보 및 유도자 배치가 필요하다는 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반으로 연결시켜 설명합니다.\n[sai-00005] helpful=1 harmful=1 :: Emphasize the criticality of following LOTO procedures by detailing steps involved, including lock, tag, and try methods, to ensure machinery is completely de-energized before maintenance.\n[sai-00008] helpful=0 harmful=2 :: Focus on conveying only the most relevant safety rule violations without extraneous details. Prioritize clarity and brevity.\n[sai-00010] helpful=0 harmful=3 :: 사고 분석 시 발생할 수 있는 다양한 시나리오를 고려하여, 각 시나리오별로 자주 발생하는 안전 수칙 위반 사항들을 구체적으로 나열하고 해당 위반 사항들이 어떤 안전 수칙과 관련이 있는지 설명합니다.\n[sai-00011] helpful=0 harmful=2 :: Stress the equal importance of both LOTO procedures and machine power disconnection in industrial safety protocols. Clarify that while LOTO ensures machinery remains de-energized throughout maintenance, explicitly verifying and emphasizing the act of power disconnection is equally vital.\n[sai-00012] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Include specific examples of commonly overlooked safety regulations in accident analysis contexts, such as '작업 구역 내 출입 통제' and '비상 정지 장치 작동 확인', to guide users towards recognizing and mentioning these crucial aspects.\n[sai-00013] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Prioritize direct responses to the question's focal point, particularly regarding LOTO procedures, and minimize discussion of secondary safety violations unless they have a clear connection.\n[sai-00015] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: 개별 안전 수칙 위반 사항들 사이의 관계를 이해하고 이를 통해 전체적인 안전 관리 원칙과의 연계를 명확히 하도록 강조합니다. 특히, 여러 위반 사항이 하나의 주요 안전 원칙 위반이 될 수 있음을 인식하고 이를 설명하는 방법을 포함합니다.\n[sai-00016] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: 기계 유지보수 전에 모든 에너지원이 완전히 차단되었음을 보장하기 위한 검증 단계를 포함하는 LOTO 절차의 세부사항을 강조하십시오.\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n[calc-00014] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Develop a formula-based approach to prioritize safety rule violations based on their frequency in incident reports.\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Highlight common errors related to neglecting LOTO procedures, such as failing to secure all energy sources before maintenance work begins.\n[err-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Detail common mistakes such as improper application of locks/tags, failure to verify isolation, and unauthorized removal of tags/locks which compromise safety.\n[err-00009] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Avoid providing excessive details that do not directly relate to solving the problem at hand. Ensure every piece of information contributes meaningfully to addressing the core issues.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n[misc-00003] helpful=1 harmful=10 :: Include indicators that suggest the necessity of LOTO implementation, e.g., scenarios involving equipment servicing or adjustments where unintended activation could pose risks.\n[misc-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Identify key indicators necessitating LOTO usage, such as visible mechanical adjustments, service alerts, or history of accidental reactivation incidents.\n\n**Reflection:**\n(empty)\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 높은 선반의 재고 조사를 위해 지게차 포크 위에 파레트를 얹고 작업자 정 수진가 타고 올라갔습니다. 추락 방지 조치는 없었습니다.\n\n**Context:**\n\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",  \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"calc-00001\", \"fin-00002\"],  \n  \"final_answer\": \"[Your concise final answer here]\"\n}\n\n---\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given scenario, we identify several safety hazards and violations. The worker climbed onto a pallet placed on the forks of a forklift to conduct inventory checks on high shelves. This action inherently poses significant fall risks due to lack of fall protection measures. According to [sai-00004], it’s important to specify safety regulation breaches like inadequate visibility and absence of a spotter. Additionally, [sai-00012] suggests highlighting often-overlooked safety rules like '작업 구역 내 출입 통제'. In this case, no fall prevention measures were mentioned, indicating non-compliance with standard safety practices.\", \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"sai-00004\", \"sai-00012\"], \n  \"final_answer\": \"The primary safety risk identified is the potential for falls from height due to the absence of any fall protection measures when the worker used a forklift to access high shelves. Key violated safety rules include the lack of proper visibility management and absence of a designated spotter.\"\n}",
