Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 높은 선반의 재고 조사를 위해 지게차 포크 위에 파레트를 얹고 작업자 조 현우가 타고 올라갔습니다. 추락 방지 조치는 없었습니다.\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given scenario, we identify several key points from the playbook that help us understand the situation better. The absence of fall protection measures when worker Jo Hyun-woo climbed onto a pallet on a forklift to conduct inventory checks on high shelves indicates significant safety regulation violations. According to [sai-00004], it’s important to specify the violated safety rules clearly, like lack of fall protection and improper use of equipment. Additionally, [misc-00003] suggests considering scenarios requiring LOTO procedures; however, this isn't applicable here since no maintenance activity was mentioned. We focus primarily on the immediate hazards present.\", \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"sai-00004\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"The primary safety risk identified is the lack of fall protection measures. Violated safety rules include inadequate safeguards against falls and improper use of a forklift for elevating workers.\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nThe primary safety risk identified is the lack of fall protection measures. Violated safety rules include inadequate safeguards against falls and improper use of a forklift for elevating workers.\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\n지게차 포크 탑승 금지 및 고소작업대 사용\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n[sai-00004] helpful=10 harmful=23 :: 사고 분석 시 원인과 관련된 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반 사항을 명확히 기술하도록 강조합니다. 예를 들어, 지게차 사고의 경우 시야 제한이나 유도자 부재를 전방 시야 확보 및 유도자 배치가 필요하다는 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반으로 연결시켜 설명합니다.\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"The model analyzed the scenario involving worker Jo Hyun-woo using a forklift improperly for elevation without any fall protection measures. It correctly identified the lack of fall protection as a major issue but failed to mention the specific violation related to riding on a forklift fork, which directly correlates to the ground truth answer regarding prohibitions on riding on forks and the requirement to use elevated work platforms.\", \"error_identification\": \"The model incorrectly focused only on general fall protection issues and misuse of equipment, missing the explicit rule about prohibiting riding on forklift forks and failing to highlight the necessity of using proper elevated work platforms.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"This oversight likely stems from a misunderstanding or underemphasis of specific operational regulations concerning forklift usage and safe working practices at height. The model might have generalized the safety risks rather than pinpointing precise rule violations stated in the ground truth.\", \"correct_approach\": \"The model should have explicitly connected the act of climbing onto a pallet on a forklift to the specific safety rule violations such as prohibition against riding on forklift forks and the mandatory use of appropriate elevated work platforms. This would align more closely with the provided ground truth.\", \"key_insight\": \"To improve accuracy, the model must ensure thorough consideration of all relevant safety protocols, especially those pertaining to specific equipment operations and elevation-related tasks. Detailed knowledge of industry-specific safety standards is crucial.\", \"bullet_tags\": [{\"id\": \"sai-00004\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}]}",
