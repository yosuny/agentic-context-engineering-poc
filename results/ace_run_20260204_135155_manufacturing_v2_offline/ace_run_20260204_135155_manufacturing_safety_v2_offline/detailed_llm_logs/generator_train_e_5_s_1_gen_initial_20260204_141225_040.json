  "prompt": "You are an analysis expert tasked with answering questions using your knowledge, a curated playbook of strategies and insights and a reflection that goes over the diagnosis of all previous mistakes made while answering the question.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Read the playbook carefully and apply relevant strategies, formulas, and insights\n- Pay attention to common mistakes listed in the playbook and avoid them\n- Show your reasoning step-by-step\n- Be concise but thorough in your analysis\n- If the playbook contains relevant code snippets or formulas, use them appropriately\n- Double-check your calculations and logic before providing the final answer\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- bullet_ids: each line in the playbook has a bullet_id. all bulletpoints in the playbook that's relevant, helpful for you to answer this question, you should include their bullet_id in this list\n- final_answer: your concise final answer\n\n\n**Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n[sai-00001] helpful=10 harmful=16 :: Emphasize the significance of LOTO (Lock-Out, Tag-Out) procedures in industrial settings. Explain how LOTO prevents unexpected energy release during maintenance activities.\n[sai-00004] helpful=10 harmful=18 :: 사고 분석 시 원인과 관련된 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반 사항을 명확히 기술하도록 강조합니다. 예를 들어, 지게차 사고의 경우 시야 제한이나 유도자 부재를 전방 시야 확보 및 유도자 배치가 필요하다는 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반으로 연결시켜 설명합니다.\n[sai-00005] helpful=1 harmful=1 :: Emphasize the criticality of following LOTO procedures by detailing steps involved, including lock, tag, and try methods, to ensure machinery is completely de-energized before maintenance.\n[sai-00008] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Focus on conveying only the most relevant safety rule violations without extraneous details. Prioritize clarity and brevity.\n[sai-00010] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: 사고 분석 시 발생할 수 있는 다양한 시나리오를 고려하여, 각 시나리오별로 자주 발생하는 안전 수칙 위반 사항들을 구체적으로 나열하고 해당 위반 사항들이 어떤 안전 수칙과 관련이 있는지 설명합니다.\n[sai-00011] helpful=0 harmful=1 :: Stress the equal importance of both LOTO procedures and machine power disconnection in industrial safety protocols. Clarify that while LOTO ensures machinery remains de-energized throughout maintenance, explicitly verifying and emphasizing the act of power disconnection is equally vital.\n[sai-00012] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Include specific examples of commonly overlooked safety regulations in accident analysis contexts, such as '작업 구역 내 출입 통제' and '비상 정지 장치 작동 확인', to guide users towards recognizing and mentioning these crucial aspects.\n[sai-00013] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Prioritize direct responses to the question's focal point, particularly regarding LOTO procedures, and minimize discussion of secondary safety violations unless they have a clear connection.\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n[calc-00014] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Develop a formula-based approach to prioritize safety rule violations based on their frequency in incident reports.\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Highlight common errors related to neglecting LOTO procedures, such as failing to secure all energy sources before maintenance work begins.\n[err-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Detail common mistakes such as improper application of locks/tags, failure to verify isolation, and unauthorized removal of tags/locks which compromise safety.\n[err-00009] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Avoid providing excessive details that do not directly relate to solving the problem at hand. Ensure every piece of information contributes meaningfully to addressing the core issues.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n[misc-00003] helpful=1 harmful=8 :: Include indicators that suggest the necessity of LOTO implementation, e.g., scenarios involving equipment servicing or adjustments where unintended activation could pose risks.\n[misc-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Identify key indicators necessitating LOTO usage, such as visible mechanical adjustments, service alerts, or history of accidental reactivation incidents.\n\n**Reflection:**\n(empty)\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 황산 탱크에서 소분 용기로 화학물질을 옮겨 담는 중입니다. 작업자 강 도현는 일반 면장갑과 마스크만 착용한 채 작업을 진행하다가 용액이 튀었습니다.\n\n**Context:**\n\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",  \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"calc-00001\", \"fin-00002\"],  \n  \"final_answer\": \"[Your concise final answer here]\"\n}\n\n---\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given scenario, we identify several important factors. The situation involves transferring chemicals from a sulfuric acid tank to a smaller container. The worker, Kang Do-hyun, was wearing regular cotton gloves and a mask, but no additional protective gear. Chemical splashes occurred during the task. Key points to consider include the lack of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), absence of proper containment measures, and insufficient safety precautions like eyewear or chemical-resistant gloves. These oversights highlight significant deviations from standard safety practices.\", \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"sai-00004\", \"sai-00008\", \"sai-00010\", \"sai-00012\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"The primary safety hazards identified involve inadequate PPE, specifically lacking chemical-resistant gloves and eye protection. Additionally, there were no containment measures observed. Violations include non-compliance with safety standards requiring suitable protective gear when handling hazardous substances.\"\n}",
