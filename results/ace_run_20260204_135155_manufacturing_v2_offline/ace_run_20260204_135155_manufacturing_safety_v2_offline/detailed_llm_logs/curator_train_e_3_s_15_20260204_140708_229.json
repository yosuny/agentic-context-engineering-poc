  "prompt": "You are a master curator of knowledge. Your job is to identify what new insights should be added to an existing playbook based on a reflection from a previous attempt.\n\n**Context:**\n- The playbook you created will be used to help answering similar questions. \n- The reflection is generated using ground truth answers that will NOT be available when the playbook is being used. So you need to come up with content that can aid the playbook user to create predictions that likely align with ground truth. \n\n**CRITICAL: You MUST respond with valid JSON only. Do not use markdown formatting or code blocks.**\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Review the existing playbook and the reflection from the previous attempt\n- Identify ONLY the NEW insights, strategies, or mistakes that are MISSING from the current playbook\n- Avoid redundancy - if similar advice already exists, only add new content that is a perfect complement to the existing playbook\n- Do NOT regenerate the entire playbook - only provide the additions needed\n- Focus on quality over quantity - a focused, well-organized playbook is better than an exhaustive one\n- Format your response as a PURE JSON object with specific sections\n- For any operation if no new content to add, return an empty list for the operations field\n- Be concise and specific - each addition should be actionable\n\n\n**Training Context:**\n- Total token budget: 80000 tokens\n- Training progress: Sample 15 out of 15\n\n**Current Playbook Stats:**\n{\n  \"total_bullets\": 11,\n  \"high_performing\": 0,\n  \"problematic\": 4,\n  \"unused\": 7,\n  \"by_section\": {\n    \"STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\": {\n      \"count\": 6,\n      \"helpful\": 13,\n      \"harmful\": 28\n    },\n    \"COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\": {\n      \"count\": 3,\n      \"helpful\": 0,\n      \"harmful\": 0\n    },\n    \"OTHERS\": {\n      \"count\": 2,\n      \"helpful\": 0,\n      \"harmful\": 5\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n**Recent Reflection:**\n{\"reasoning\": \"모델의 추론 과정을 보면, 지게차의 허용 하중을 초과하여 적재하고 운전자가 안전벨트를 착용하지 않은 것을 지적하며 이것이 안전 규칙 위반이라고 설명했습니다. 이 부분은 환경 피드백에서도 일치한다고 평가받았습니다.\", \"error_identification\": \"환경 피드백에 따르면 예측 답변이 정답과 일치하므로 오류가 없습니다.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"오류가 발생하지 않았으므로 근본 원인 분석도 필요하지 않습니다.\", \"correct_approach\": \"현재 접근법이 이미 올바르므로 수정할 필요가 없습니다.\", \"key_insight\": \"안전 규칙 위반 사항 식별과 그 결과로 인한 잠재적 위험 요소를 정확하게 파악하는 것이 중요합니다.\", \"bullet_tags\": [{\"id\": \"sai-00004\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"}]}\n\n**Current Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n[sai-00001] helpful=6 harmful=13 :: Emphasize the significance of LOTO (Lock-Out, Tag-Out) procedures in industrial settings. Explain how LOTO prevents unexpected energy release during maintenance activities.\n[sai-00004] helpful=6 harmful=14 :: 사고 분석 시 원인과 관련된 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반 사항을 명확히 기술하도록 강조합니다. 예를 들어, 지게차 사고의 경우 시야 제한이나 유도자 부재를 전방 시야 확보 및 유도자 배치가 필요하다는 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반으로 연결시켜 설명합니다.\n[sai-00005] helpful=1 harmful=1 :: Emphasize the criticality of following LOTO procedures by detailing steps involved, including lock, tag, and try methods, to ensure machinery is completely de-energized before maintenance.\n[sai-00008] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Focus on conveying only the most relevant safety rule violations without extraneous details. Prioritize clarity and brevity.\n[sai-00010] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: 사고 분석 시 발생할 수 있는 다양한 시나리오를 고려하여, 각 시나리오별로 자주 발생하는 안전 수칙 위반 사항들을 구체적으로 나열하고 해당 위반 사항들이 어떤 안전 수칙과 관련이 있는지 설명합니다.\n[sai-00011] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Stress the equal importance of both LOTO procedures and machine power disconnection in industrial safety protocols. Clarify that while LOTO ensures machinery remains de-energized throughout maintenance, explicitly verifying and emphasizing the act of power disconnection is equally vital.\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Highlight common errors related to neglecting LOTO procedures, such as failing to secure all energy sources before maintenance work begins.\n[err-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Detail common mistakes such as improper application of locks/tags, failure to verify isolation, and unauthorized removal of tags/locks which compromise safety.\n[err-00009] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Avoid providing excessive details that do not directly relate to solving the problem at hand. Ensure every piece of information contributes meaningfully to addressing the core issues.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n[misc-00003] helpful=0 harmful=5 :: Include indicators that suggest the necessity of LOTO implementation, e.g., scenarios involving equipment servicing or adjustments where unintended activation could pose risks.\n[misc-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Identify key indicators necessitating LOTO usage, such as visible mechanical adjustments, service alerts, or history of accidental reactivation incidents.\n\n**Question Context:**\n\n\n**Your Task:**\nOutput ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- operations: a list of operations to be performed on the playbook\n  - type: the type of operation to be performed\n  - section: the section to add the bullet to\n  - content: the new content of the bullet\n\n**Available Operations:**\n1. ADD: Create new bullet points with fresh IDs\n    - section: the section to add the new bullet to\n    - content: the new content of the bullet. Note: no need to include the bullet_id in the content like '[ctx-00263] helpful=1 harmful=0 ::', the bullet_id will be added by the system.\n\n**RESPONSE FORMAT - Output ONLY this JSON structure (no markdown, no code blocks):**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations here]\",\n  \"operations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ADD\", \n      \"section\": \"formulas_and_calculations\",\n      \"content\": \"[New calculation method...]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n---\n",
