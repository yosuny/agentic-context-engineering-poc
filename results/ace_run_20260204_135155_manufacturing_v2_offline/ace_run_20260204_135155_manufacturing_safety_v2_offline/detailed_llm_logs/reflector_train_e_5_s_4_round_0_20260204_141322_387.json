  "prompt": "You are an expert analyst and educator. Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 유기용제(TCE)를 사용하여 부품을 세척 중입니다. 국소배기장치가 고장 난 상태에서 작업자 정 수진는 일반 마스크를 쓰고 장시간 노출되었습니다.\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given scenario, we identify two primary safety hazards and violations. Firstly, the malfunctioning local exhaust ventilation system poses a significant risk due to inadequate control of hazardous organic solvent fumes. Secondly, worker Jung Soojin was exposed to these toxic fumes for prolonged periods wearing merely a standard mask instead of appropriate respiratory protection. This situation violates several safety rules concerning proper handling of hazardous materials and ensuring adequate personal protective equipment.\", \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"sai-00008\", \"sai-00010\", \"misc-00003\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"The identified safety hazards involve a faulty local exhaust ventilation system allowing exposure to organic solvents like TCE, and insufficient respiratory protection used by the worker. The violated safety rules encompass proper hazard containment via functional ventilation systems and mandatory use of suitable respirators when dealing with toxic substances.\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nThe identified safety hazards involve a faulty local exhaust ventilation system allowing exposure to organic solvents like TCE, and insufficient respiratory protection used by the worker. The violated safety rules encompass proper hazard containment via functional ventilation systems and mandatory use of suitable respirators when dealing with toxic substances.\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\n국소배기장치 가동 및 유기화합물용 호흡보호구 착용\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n[sai-00008] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Focus on conveying only the most relevant safety rule violations without extraneous details.

  "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"The model's reasoning correctly identifies the malfunctioning local exhaust ventilation system as a safety hazard and notes the worker's prolonged exposure while using a standard mask instead of appropriate respiratory protection. However, the model fails to directly address the core issue succinctly and align its response more closely with the concise nature of the ground truth answer.\", \"error_identification\": \"The main error lies in the discrepancy between the model's detailed explanation and the expected brief format of the answer. Additionally, the model includes unnecessary complexity rather than focusing solely on the critical points needed to match the ground truth.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"This error likely stems from misunderstanding the required conciseness and directness of the answer format.
