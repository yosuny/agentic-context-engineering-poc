Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 높은 선반의 재고 조사를 위해 지게차 포크 위에 파레트를 얹고 작업자 정 수진가 타고 올라갔습니다. 추락 방지 조치는 없었습니다.\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given scenario, we identify several safety hazards and violations. The worker climbed onto a pallet placed on a forklift to conduct inventory checks on high shelves without any fall protection measures. This situation highlights significant safety rule violations, specifically concerning the lack of proper fall prevention mechanisms and potentially unsafe practices associated with operating a forklift. According to the provided playbook, [sai-00004], it emphasizes specifying concrete safety regulation breaches like inadequate visibility or absence of guides when discussing accidents. In our case, the absence of fall protection aligns with this guideline.

  "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"The model analyzed the scenario and correctly identified the lack of fall protection as a major safety hazard. However, it failed to mention the specific violation related to riding on a forklift fork, which is explicitly prohibited. It also didn't address the use of a high lift device, which would have been a more appropriate approach according to the ground truth. The model referenced guidelines from the playbook but missed connecting them to the core issues highlighted in the ground truth.\", \"error_identification\": \"The model incorrectly focused solely on the lack of fall protection while missing other critical aspects such as the prohibition against riding on a forklift fork and the failure to use a high lift device.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model misunderstood the scope of the safety regulations involved, focusing narrowly on fall protection rather than considering all relevant safety rules and best practices. This oversight led to incomplete identification of the violations.\", \"correct_approach\": \"The model should have included both the prohibition against riding on a forklift fork and the requirement to use a high lift device in its analysis. These elements were crucial to fully addressing the safety risks and regulatory violations present in the scenario.\", \"key_insight\": \"When diagnosing safety violations, it is essential to consider all applicable safety regulations and best practices, not just one aspect.
