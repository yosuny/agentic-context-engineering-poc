  "prompt": "You are an expert analyst and educator. Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 유기용제(TCE)를 사용하여 부품을 세척 중입니다. 국소배기장치가 고장 난 상태에서 작업자 정 수진는 일반 마스크를 쓰고 장시간 노출되었습니다.\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given scenario, we identify two primary safety hazards and associated rule violations. Firstly, the malfunctioning local exhaust ventilation system poses a significant risk due to inadequate control of hazardous fumes from organic solvents like TCE. This situation violates safety rules concerning proper ventilation systems and their regular inspection and maintenance. Secondly, worker Jung Soojin was exposed to TCE for prolonged periods wearing only a general mask, indicating non-compliance with personal protective equipment standards specifically designed for handling toxic substances.\", \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"sai-00008\", \"sai-00010\", \"sai-00012\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"The identified safety hazards involve a faulty local exhaust ventilation system leading to inadequate control of hazardous fumes, and insufficient personal protective measures allowing prolonged exposure to TCE. The violated safety rules encompass the requirement for functional ventilation systems and appropriate PPE when dealing with toxic chemicals.\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nThe identified safety hazards involve a faulty local exhaust ventilation system leading to inadequate control of hazardous fumes, and insufficient personal protective measures allowing prolonged exposure to TCE. The violated safety rules encompass the requirement for functional ventilation systems and appropriate PPE when dealing with toxic chemicals.\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\n국소배기장치 가동 및 유기화합물용 호흡보호구 착용\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n[sai-00008] helpful=0 harmful=1 :: Focus on conveying only the most relevant safety rule violations without extraneous details. Prioritize clarity and brevity.\n[sai-00010] helpful=0 harmful=2 :: 사고 분석 시 발생할 수 있는 다양한 시나리오를 고려하여, 각 시나리오별로 자주 발생하는 안전 수칙 위반 사항들을 구체적으로 나열하고 해당 위반 사항들이 어떤 안전 수칙과 관련이 있는지 설명합니다.\n[sai-00012] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Include specific examples of commonly overlooked safety regulations in accident analysis contexts, such as '작업 구역 내 출입 통제' and '비상 정지 장치 작동 확인', to guide users towards recognizing and mentioning these crucial aspects.\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"The model's reasoning correctly identifies the main issues related to the malfunctioning local exhaust ventilation system and the use of inappropriate personal protective equipment during the cleaning process involving TCE. However, the model fails to align its final answer precisely with the concise expected response provided in the ground truth. It elaborates more than necessary, including additional context rather than focusing solely on the core elements required by the question.\", \"error_identification\": \"The model's predicted answer includes excessive detail and deviates from the succinctness demanded by the ground truth. Instead of directly stating the critical safety rule violations ('국소배기장치 가동' and '유기화합물용 호흡보호구 착용'), it provides a broader explanation.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"This deviation likely stems from misunderstanding the instruction to prioritize conciseness and direct alignment with the ground truth over providing comprehensive explanations. The model may have prioritized thoroughness over precision.\", \"correct_approach\": \"The model should focus on delivering answers that strictly adhere to the requirements of the question, emphasizing brevity and direct relevance. In cases requiring identification of specific safety rules, the model must ensure its responses mirror those precise points without unnecessary elaboration.\", \"key_insight\": \"When addressing questions focused on identifying specific items or rules, always aim for accuracy and brevity. Avoid adding supplementary information unless explicitly asked for. Ensure every element mentioned in the answer corresponds exactly to the query's demands.\", \"bullet_tags\": [{\"id\": \"sai-00008\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}, {\"id\": \"sai-00010\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}, {\"id\": \"sai-00012\", \"tag\": \"neutral\"}]}",
