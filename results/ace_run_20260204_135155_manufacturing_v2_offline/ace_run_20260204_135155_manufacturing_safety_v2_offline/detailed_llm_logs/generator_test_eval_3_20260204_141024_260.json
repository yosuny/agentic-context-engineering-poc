  "prompt": "You are an analysis expert tasked with answering questions using your knowledge, a curated playbook of strategies and insights and a reflection that goes over the diagnosis of all previous mistakes made while answering the question.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Read the playbook carefully and apply relevant strategies, formulas, and insights\n- Pay attention to common mistakes listed in the playbook and avoid them\n- Show your reasoning step-by-step\n- Be concise but thorough in your analysis\n- If the playbook contains relevant code snippets or formulas, use them appropriately\n- Double-check your calculations and logic before providing the final answer\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- bullet_ids: each line in the playbook has a bullet_id. all bulletpoints in the playbook that's relevant, helpful for you to answer this question, you should include their bullet_id in this list\n- final_answer: your concise final answer\n\n\n**Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n[sai-00001] helpful=7 harmful=15 :: Emphasize the significance of LOTO (Lock-Out, Tag-Out) procedures in industrial settings. Explain how LOTO prevents unexpected energy release during maintenance activities.\n[sai-00004] helpful=8 harmful=18 :: 사고 분석 시 원인과 관련된 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반 사항을 명확히 기술하도록 강조합니다. 예를 들어, 지게차 사고의 경우 시야 제한이나 유도자 부재를 전방 시야 확보 및 유도자 배치가 필요하다는 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반으로 연결시켜 설명합니다.\n[sai-00005] helpful=1 harmful=1 :: Emphasize the criticality of following LOTO procedures by detailing steps involved, including lock, tag, and try methods, to ensure machinery is completely de-energized before maintenance.\n[sai-00008] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Focus on conveying only the most relevant safety rule violations without extraneous details. Prioritize clarity and brevity.\n[sai-00010] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: 사고 분석 시 발생할 수 있는 다양한 시나리오를 고려하여, 각 시나리오별로 자주 발생하는 안전 수칙 위반 사항들을 구체적으로 나열하고 해당 위반 사항들이 어떤 안전 수칙과 관련이 있는지 설명합니다.\n[sai-00011] helpful=0 harmful=1 :: Stress the equal importance of both LOTO procedures and machine power disconnection in industrial safety protocols. Clarify that while LOTO ensures machinery remains de-energized throughout maintenance, explicitly verifying and emphasizing the act of power disconnection is equally vital.\n[sai-00012] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Include specific examples of commonly overlooked safety regulations in accident analysis contexts, such as '작업 구역 내 출입 통제' and '비상 정지 장치 작동 확인', to guide users towards recognizing and mentioning these crucial aspects.\n[sai-00013] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Prioritize direct responses to the question's focal point, particularly regarding LOTO procedures, and minimize discussion of secondary safety violations unless they have a clear connection.\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Highlight common errors related to neglecting LOTO procedures, such as failing to secure all energy sources before maintenance work begins.\n[err-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Detail common mistakes such as improper application of locks/tags, failure to verify isolation, and unauthorized removal of tags/locks which compromise safety.\n[err-00009] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Avoid providing excessive details that do not directly relate to solving the problem at hand. Ensure every piece of information contributes meaningfully to addressing the core issues.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n[misc-00003] helpful=0 harmful=8 :: Include indicators that suggest the necessity of LOTO implementation, e.g., scenarios involving equipment servicing or adjustments where unintended activation could pose risks.\n[misc-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Identify key indicators necessitating LOTO usage, such as visible mechanical adjustments, service alerts, or history of accidental reactivation incidents.\n\n**Reflection:**\n(empty)\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 유기용제(TCE)를 사용하여 부품을 세척 중입니다. 국소배기장치가 고장 난 상태에서 작업자 정 수진는 일반 마스크를 쓰고 장시간 노출되었습니다.\n\n**Context:**\n\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",  \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"calc-00001\", \"fin-00002\"],  \n  \"final_answer\": \"[Your concise final answer here]\"\n}\n\n---\n",
  "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given scenario, we identify two primary safety hazards and violations. Firstly, the local exhaust ventilation system was malfunctioning, leading to inadequate control of hazardous fumes. Secondly, worker Jung Su-jin wore a regular mask instead of appropriate respiratory protection designed for organic solvent exposure, resulting in prolonged inhalation risk. These factors align with [sai-00004], highlighting the need to specify safety regulation breaches like insufficient protective measures against toxic substances and lack of proper PPE.\", \"bullet_ids\": [\"sai-00004\"], \"final_answer\": \"The identified safety hazards involve a malfunctioning local exhaust ventilation system and the use of inappropriate respiratory protection. The violated safety rules pertain to controlling hazardous fume exposure and ensuring correct personal protective equipment.\"}",
