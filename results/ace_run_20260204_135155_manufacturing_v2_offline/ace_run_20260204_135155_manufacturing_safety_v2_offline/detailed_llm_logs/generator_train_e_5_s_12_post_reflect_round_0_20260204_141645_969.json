  "prompt": "You are an analysis expert tasked with answering questions using your knowledge, a curated playbook of strategies and insights and a reflection that goes over the diagnosis of all previous mistakes made while answering the question.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Read the playbook carefully and apply relevant strategies, formulas, and insights\n- Pay attention to common mistakes listed in the playbook and avoid them\n- Show your reasoning step-by-step\n- Be concise but thorough in your analysis\n- If the playbook contains relevant code snippets or formulas, use them appropriately\n- Double-check your calculations and logic before providing the final answer\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- bullet_ids: each line in the playbook has a bullet_id. all bulletpoints in the playbook that's relevant, helpful for you to answer this question, you should include their bullet_id in this list\n- final_answer: your concise final answer\n\n\n**Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n[sai-00001] helpful=11 harmful=18 :: Emphasize the significance of LOTO (Lock-Out, Tag-Out) procedures in industrial settings. Explain how LOTO prevents unexpected energy release during maintenance activities.\n[sai-00004] helpful=11 harmful=25 :: 사고 분석 시 원인과 관련된 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반 사항을 명확히 기술하도록 강조합니다. 예를 들어, 지게차 사고의 경우 시야 제한이나 유도자 부재를 전방 시야 확보 및 유도자 배치가 필요하다는 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반으로 연결시켜 설명합니다.\n[sai-00005] helpful=1 harmful=1 :: Emphasize the criticality of following LOTO procedures by detailing steps involved, including lock, tag, and try methods, to ensure machinery is completely de-energized before maintenance.\n[sai-00008] helpful=0 harmful=2 :: Focus on conveying only the most relevant safety rule violations without extraneous details. Prioritize clarity and brevity.\n[sai-00010] helpful=0 harmful=3 :: 사고 분석 시 발생할 수 있는 다양한 시나리오를 고려하여, 각 시나리오별로 자주 발생하는 안전 수칙 위반 사항들을 구체적으로 나열하고 해당 위반 사항들이 어떤 안전 수칙과 관련이 있는지 설명합니다.\n[sai-00011] helpful=0 harmful=2 :: Stress the equal importance of both LOTO procedures and machine power disconnection in industrial safety protocols. Clarify that while LOTO ensures machinery remains de-energized throughout maintenance, explicitly verifying and emphasizing the act of power disconnection is equally vital.\n[sai-00012] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Include specific examples of commonly overlooked safety regulations in accident analysis contexts, such as '작업 구역 내 출입 통제' and '비상 정지 장치 작동 확인', to guide users towards recognizing and mentioning these crucial aspects.\n[sai-00013] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Prioritize direct responses to the question's focal point, particularly regarding LOTO procedures, and minimize discussion of secondary safety violations unless they have a clear connection.\n[sai-00015] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: 개별 안전 수칙 위반 사항들 사이의 관계를 이해하고 이를 통해 전체적인 안전 관리 원칙과의 연계를 명확히 하도록 강조합니다. 특히, 여러 위반 사항이 하나의 주요 안전 원칙 위반이 될 수 있음을 인식하고 이를 설명하는 방법을 포함합니다.\n[sai-00016] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: 기계 유지보수 전에 모든 에너지원이 완전히 차단되었음을 보장하기 위한 검증 단계를 포함하는 LOTO 절차의 세부사항을 강조하십시오.\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n[calc-00014] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Develop a formula-based approach to prioritize safety rule violations based on their frequency in incident reports.\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Highlight common errors related to neglecting LOTO procedures, such as failing to secure all energy sources before maintenance work begins.\n[err-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Detail common mistakes such as improper application of locks/tags, failure to verify isolation, and unauthorized removal of tags/locks which compromise safety.\n[err-00009] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Avoid providing excessive details that do not directly relate to solving the problem at hand. Ensure every piece of information contributes meaningfully to addressing the core issues.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n[misc-00003] helpful=1 harmful=10 :: Include indicators that suggest the necessity of LOTO implementation, e.g., scenarios involving equipment servicing or adjustments where unintended activation could pose risks.\n[misc-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Identify key indicators necessitating LOTO usage, such as visible mechanical adjustments, service alerts, or history of accidental reactivation incidents.\n\n**Reflection:**\n{\"reasoning\": \"The model analyzed the scenario and correctly identified the lack of fall protection as a major safety hazard. However, it failed to mention the specific violation related to riding on a forklift fork, which is explicitly prohibited. It also didn't address the use of a high lift device, which would have been a more appropriate approach according to the ground truth. The model referenced guidelines from the playbook but missed connecting them to the core issues highlighted in the ground truth.\", \"error_identification\": \"The model incorrectly focused solely on the lack of fall protection while missing other critical aspects such as the prohibition against riding on a forklift fork and the failure to use a high lift device.\", \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model misunderstood the scope of the safety regulations involved, focusing narrowly on fall protection rather than considering all relevant safety rules and best practices. This oversight led to incomplete identification of the violations.\", \"correct_approach\": \"The model should have included both the prohibition against riding on a forklift fork and the requirement to use a high lift device in its analysis. These elements were crucial to fully addressing the safety risks and regulatory violations present in the scenario.\", \"key_insight\": \"When diagnosing safety violations, it is essential to consider all applicable safety regulations and best practices, not just one aspect. A comprehensive review ensures no critical details are overlooked.\", \"bullet_tags\": [{\"id\": \"sai-00004\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}, {\"id\": \"misc-00003\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}]}\n\n**Question:**\n다음 상황에서 발견된 안전 위험 요소와 위반된 핵심 수칙은 무엇인가?\n상황: 높은 선반의 재고 조사를 위해 지게차 포크 위에 파레트를 얹고 작업자 정 수진가 타고 올라갔습니다. 추락 방지 조치는 없었습니다.\n\n**Context:**\n\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",  \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"calc-00001\", \"fin-00002\"],  \n  \"final_answer\": \"[Your concise final answer here]\"\n}\n\n---\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In analyzing the given situation, we identify two primary safety hazards and violations. Firstly, the worker climbing onto the pallet on the forklift fork without any fall protection measures constitutes a significant risk and violates standard safety protocols. Secondly, the absence of a high-lift device, which should be used instead of stacking pallets on a forklift for elevated tasks, represents another critical safety regulation breach. By referencing the playbook, we understand the importance of adhering strictly to safety rules like proper equipment usage and personal protective measures.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"sai-00004\", \"misc-00003\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"주요 안전 위험 요소로는 작업자가 추락 방지 조치 없이 지게차 포크 위의 팔레트에 올라간 점과 고공 작업을 위해 하이 리프트 장치를 사용하지 않은 점이 있습니다.\"\n}",
