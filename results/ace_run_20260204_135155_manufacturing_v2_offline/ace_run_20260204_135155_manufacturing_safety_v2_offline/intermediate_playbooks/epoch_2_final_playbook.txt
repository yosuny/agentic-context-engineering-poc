## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS

[sai-00001] helpful=3 harmful=10 :: Emphasize the significance of LOTO (Lock-Out, Tag-Out) procedures in industrial settings. Explain how LOTO prevents unexpected energy release during maintenance activities.
[sai-00004] helpful=4 harmful=4 :: 사고 분석 시 원인과 관련된 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반 사항을 명확히 기술하도록 강조합니다. 예를 들어, 지게차 사고의 경우 시야 제한이나 유도자 부재를 전방 시야 확보 및 유도자 배치가 필요하다는 구체적인 안전 수칙 위반으로 연결시켜 설명합니다.
[sai-00005] helpful=1 harmful=0 :: Emphasize the criticality of following LOTO procedures by detailing steps involved, including lock, tag, and try methods, to ensure machinery is completely de-energized before maintenance.
[sai-00008] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Focus on conveying only the most relevant safety rule violations without extraneous details. Prioritize clarity and brevity.
